## Topics

The first topic that I'm interested in is setting up Logging and Management Infrastructure for cyber.local. For this project, the client would be Devin and he wants to create a Wazuh and/or Elastic logging and network management system setup for the cyber.local network. There are some important features that are noted as requirements, this includes "dashboards that show system status, logged on users, resource utilization and security events".

I'm interested in pursuing this topic as my first choice because I think it will give me great hands on experience implementing and working with a Security Information Event Management (SIEM) system. I also like the idea of this being a service project and doing something that could be very beneficial for a network like cyber.local.

The second topic that I'm interested in is Cloud Integration for cyber.local. For this project, the client would be Adam and he wants to create a cloud centralized integration of the cyber.local network. The results of this would allow the CNCS division to manage the big picture billing and user access controls of the cloud consoles. And students will have customized access to deploy and manage their personal systems.

I'm interested in pursuing this topic as my second choice because I think it will expand my knowledge of not only cloud-based services but also how to integrate that into a traditional network. I also took Cloud Administration and Deployment with Adam two semesters ago and I enjoyed learning about AWS. This is another service project so I also like the fact that it will benefit the cyber.local network.
